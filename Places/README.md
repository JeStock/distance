## Core (Domain) Layer
This is the heart of the Clean/Hexagonal/Onion/Ports-n-adapters architecture.
The Core (Domain) layer contains the problem domain models and the domain-specific logic.  
Each domain model implements [Smart constructor](#type-driven-design) and [Parse, don't validate](#type-driven-design) patterns,
which are complementary, both contributing to the DDD's approach of encoding the domain's logic into the application's type system, 
[making invalid state unrepresentable](#type-driven-design).  

The Core intentionally made having no dependencies, and it's pure: no mutations, no exceptions, no side effects, no DI is used.
As a consequence, it's 100% testable without any compromises: no mocks, stubs or fakes needed, tests are simple and straightforward, yet effective.

## Tech stack
1. ASP.NET Rest Api
2. Elasticsearch
3. Serilog
4. LanguageExt

## TODO
1. Add domain layer which will be responsible to build a search query for airport by the following fields: Name, IataCode, IcaoCode
2. Add an endpoint which will accept the query as plain text
3. Add unit tests
4. (Optional) add integration tests
5. (Optional) add health checks + ELK
6. (Optional) Use Elasticsearch Geospatial data for Lat/Lon.
